  I am currently pursuing my masters in Geospatial Technologies at the University of Oklahoma. I am a detail-oriented and multidisciplinary professional with experience in laboratory science and geospatial technologies. I am interested in integrating data-driven insights with real-world applications, particularly in urban planning or environmental sustainability. I am seeking opportunities where I can apply my expertise in GIS and spatial analysis skills to projects  that make an impact in conservation and environmental planning.
